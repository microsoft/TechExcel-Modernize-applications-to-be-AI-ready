# Task 02 - Refactor files

<!--- Estimated time: 15 minutes---> 

## Introduction

The *views.py* file defines app routes, endpoints, and views. The file is divided into the following sections:

- Import statements
- Back-end API endpoints
- Front-end API endpoints

The **Dockerfile** file defines the Docker image to use and provides instructions for copying app components to the Docker container when you build the container. 

The **requirements.txt** file specifies the packages that the app requires to run. 

## Description

In the previous task, you added a copy of **views.py** to both the **FrontEnd** and **Backend** folders. You added the Dockerfile file and the **requirements.txt** file to the **FrontEnd** folder. In this task, you’ll modify all three files to remove references to back-end functionality. You’ll also modify the copy of **views.py** in the **Backend** folder to remove references to front-end functionality.

The key steps are as follows:

1. Open **views.py** from the **FrontEnd** folder in Visual Studio Code and remove the Backend API endpoints section.
1. Remove the dblayer reference from the **views.py** **Imports** section.
1. Remove the code from **views.py** that checks to see if the database is set up.
1. Update **Dockerfile** to remove the code that installs the MSSQL ODBC driver.
1. Update **requirements.txt** to remove references to the **pyodbc** and **psycopg2-binary** libraries.
1. Open **views.py** from the **BackEnd** folder in Visual Studio Code and remove the **Frontend API endpoints** section.

## Success Criteria

- You’ve updated **views.py**, **Dockerfile**, and **requirements.txt** files in the **FrontEnd** folder and removed back-end code and references to data libraries. 
- You’ve updated **views.py** in the **BackEnd** folder and removed front-end code.

## Solution

<summary>Expand this section to view the solution</summary>

In this task, you’ll refactor the front-end **views.py** file in the **UpdatedApp\FrontEnd** folder.


1. In Visual Studio Code, select **Ctrl+Shift+E** to open the Explorer pane.

1. In the Explorer pane, select **Open Folder**.

1. In the **Open Folder** dialog, select the **Downloads** folder, select **UpdatedApp**, and the select **Select Folder**.

1. In the **Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?** dialog, select **Trust the authors of all files in the parent folder 'Downloads'** and then select **Yes, I trust the authors**.

1. In the Explorer pane, expand the **frontend** folder and then expand the **contoso_hotel** folder.

1. Select **views.py**. The file displays in the right side of the Visual Studio Code window.

1. Delete all code between the following region markers in the code (at or around lines 9 - 304):

    ```
    #region -------- BACKEND API ENDPOINTS --------
    #endregion -------- BACKEND API ENDPOINTS -------- 
    ```

   > Don’t forget to delete the comma after **dblayer**.

1. Locate the code that checks to see if the database is set up (at or around lines 22-26):

    ![7xe8gkmv.png](../../media/7xe8gkmv.png)

1. Delete the code that performs the database check.
