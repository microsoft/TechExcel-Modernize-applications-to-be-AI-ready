# Task 05 - Run the containerized app and add a booking

<!--- Estimated time: 5 minutes---> 

## Introduction
You created a Docker container and pushed the container to ACR in previous tasks. Now, you’ll run the container and view the app in a browser. Since this is the first time you are running the app, you’ll need to run a process to create the database schema and populate the tables with data.

Now, you can view the various pages for the app and try out the features.
 

## Description

In this task, you’ll run the Docker app container and then display the setup page for the app. You’ll create the database schema and populate the tables with data. You’ll review common app pages and add a booking record. Finally, you’ll search for the record you just added to verify that the record was successfully added to the database.

The key steps are as follows:

1. Run the Docker container on port 8000.
1. Open the app at http://localhost:8000/setup.
1. Run the setup process in the app to add records to the database.
1. Review the app pages.
1. Add the following booking record:

    | Field | Value |
    |:---------|:---------|
    | Hotel   | **Contoso Suites Athens**  |
    | Visitor   | **Emma Davis**|
    | Check-in   | **12/28/2024**|
    | Check-out   | **01/05/2025**|
    | Adults   | **2**|
    | Rooms   | **1**|

1. Verify that the new record is saved and close the browser window.

## Success Criteria

- You can view the app in a web browser.
- You can add a booking record to the app and verify that the record is saved and is searchable.

1. Replace the *ENTER_CONNECTION_STRING_FROM_EX02_TASK04* placeholder text in the following command with the connection string you recorded in the previous task. Enter the command at the Visual Studio Code Terminal window prompt and then select **Enter**. This command starts the containerized app.

    ```
    docker run -p 8000:8000 -e POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING="ENTER_CONNECTION_STRING_FROM_EX02_TASK04;" pycontosohotel:v1.0.0
    ```
