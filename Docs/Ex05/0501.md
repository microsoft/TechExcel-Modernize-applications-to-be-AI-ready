# Task 01 - Create a postgresql user and set up an AI Hub and Prompt Flow

<!--- Estimated time: 20 minutes---> 

## Introduction

An Azure AI Studio Hub is a central resource within Azure AI Studio that helps teams manage, collaborate, and organize their AI projects. 

## Description

In this task, you’ll create a hub and then create a project within the hub. You’ll also create a PostgreSQL user so that the flow can access the database records.

The key steps are as follows:

1. Create a user for the PostgreSQL database that allows the chatbot read-only access to the **Hotels**, **Visitors**, and **Bookings** tables.
1. Set up and configure an AI Studio Hub.
1. Create a project in the hub.


## Success Criteria

- You’ve successfully created a user in the PostgreSQL database.
- You’ve created a new AI Studio Hub and created a project.

## Solution

<summary>Expand this section to view the solution</summary>

1. Open a browser window and go to [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Search for and select the PostgreSQL database that you created in a previous exercise.

1. On the menu bar for the database server, select **Cloud Shell** and then select **Bash** in the **Cloud Shell** pane.

1. Select your subscription from the dropdown list and then select **Apply**.

1. Replace the value for POSTGRESQL_SERVERNAME with the Server name that appears in the **Overview** section for your database server. Then, enter the following commands at the Cloud Shell prompt. These commands connect to the database.

    ```
    export PGHOST="POSTGRESQL_SERVERNAME"
    export PGUSER="contosoadmin"
    export PGPORT="5432"
    export PGDATABASE="pycontosohotel"
    export PGPASSWORD="1234ABcd!"
    psql
    ```

1. Enter the following SQL statement at the Cloud Shell prompt. This statement creates a read-only user for the Prompt flow chatbot:
    
    ```
    CREATE USER promptflow WITH PASSWORD '1234ABCD!';
    ```

1. Enter the following SQL statement at the Cloud Shell prompt. These statements grant the user access to the database tables.
    
    ```
    GRANT SELECT ON TABLE hotels TO promptflow;
    GRANT SELECT ON TABLE bookings TO promptflow;
    GRANT SELECT ON TABLE visitors TO promptflow;
    GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION getroomsusagewithintimespan TO promptflow;
    ```

1. Return to Visual Studio Code. Enter the following command at the Terminal window prompt. This command creates a unique name for an AI Hub.

    ```
    $AI_HUB_NAME="ai-hub$(Get-Random -Minimum 100000 -Maximum 999999)"
    Write-Host -ForegroundColor Green  "AI Hub name is: " $AI_HUB_NAME

    ```
